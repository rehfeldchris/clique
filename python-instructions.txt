i used
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.4/
64bit

then i copied
http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

into my python install dir(where python.exe lives)
then executed it via shell
>python easy_setup.py

it made a Scripts dir, and installed some files into it.

then i copied the networkx egg for 2.7 into python install dir
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx/

then i think i did this from the shell
>Scripts\easy_install.exe networkx-1.7-py2.7.egg


I also put my python install dir in my os's path variable.
